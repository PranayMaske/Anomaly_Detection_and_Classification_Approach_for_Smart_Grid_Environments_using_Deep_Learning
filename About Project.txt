Nowadays, with the advent of smart grids in smart cities, electricity consumption is being monitored more efficiently. These smart grids utilize sensors that are connected to the internet of things (IoT) to transmit electricity consumption information to a centralized server or base station. This enables the centralized server to efficiently allocate the required energy. However, due to the internet connection, these grids are vulnerable to attacks that can alter or steal data. Such attacks can lead to the transmission of incorrect information to the base station, resulting in potential grid infrastructure corruption and even blackouts.

To transmit data, smart grids and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems employ the MODBUS/TCP and DNP3 protocols. However, these protocols are susceptible to data alteration. Traditional security measures, such as statistical and signature-based detection techniques, have been introduced to mitigate these risks. Statistical techniques analyze static features of the protocol data to detect alterations, while signature-based techniques employ predefined signatures to identify attacks. However, these techniques fail to detect new or previously unseen attacks.

To address this limitation, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been introduced. However, conventional ML algorithms are not well-suited for detecting smart grid attacks. In this paper, the author proposes a novel approach using an AutoEncoder-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The AutoEncoder encodes the dataset's features, which are then used to train both the encoder and decoder. The decoder receives training labels, and the resulting trained model can be utilized to predict attacks in smart grids.

The GAN architecture consists of a Generator, which utilizes the GAN layer to generate both real and fake data, and a Discriminator, which is trained on this data to differentiate between real and fake samples. By utilizing the GAN model, the proposed approach can generate new data from a given noise input, potentially capturing various attack techniques that may be devised by an attacker. The Discriminator is then trained on this synthesized data, enabling it to effectively prevent attacks.

The main objective of this paper is to detect and classify attack types in smart grids. The detection phase involves determining whether the requested data is normal or anomalous, while the classification phase aims to identify the specific type of attack.
In our project, we have implemented the proposed AutoEncoder-GAN model, along with CNN and LSTM architectures. The MODBUS/TCP dataset was utilized to train these algorithms. The following section provides more details about the dataset.
