# Anomaly_Detection_and_Classification_Approach_for_Smart_Grid_Environments_using_Deep_Learning
  This project proposes a unified approach for anomaly detection and classification in smart grid environments using an AutoEncoder-GAN model with CNN and LSTMmodel for improved performance. It aims to enhance security by accurately detecting and classifying different attack types.
